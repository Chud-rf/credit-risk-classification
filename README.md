## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis was focused on predicting credit risk for loans. The dataset included lending information with various financial metrics for customers(loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income, etc.). The goal was to determine if a customer was a high or low credit risk. The process involved creating a dataframe with the data, seperating the data into training and testing sets, fitting the data to the Logistic Regression model, and then using the fitted model to predict outcomes.
